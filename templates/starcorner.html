        <blockquote class="testimonial--quote"><p>Trinity education not only provided me with the skills and techniques that I needed to be a successful researcher; but more importantly, it provided me with a much deeper humanistic experience that made me a confident and a compassionate human. I felt a connection to Trinity and decided to stay. I was elected to work for a year after graduation as Vice President of Trinity Graduate Studentsâ€™ Union where I represented 4600+ postgraduates in Trinity. Following this, I worked in Google and then decided to return to Trinity.  I am now pursuing my PhD in the Department of Psychology, which is something I had always wanted to do.</p></blockquote>
